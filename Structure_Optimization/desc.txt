Folder Contents:
All folders contain VASP input files used for performing each step of structure optimisation.
order of struture optimisation: ECUT optimisation --> K-points optimisation --> Lattice Constant optimisation

ECUT optimisation:
contains input VASP script for checking Energy predcited for system with different ECUT values.

K-points optimisation:
After choosing a suitable ECUT max with minimal deviations in energy of system with increasing ECUT we perform k-points optimisation for different 
k-point grid density

Lattice Constant optimisation:
Finally with the optimal K-point density grid and ECUT we check the energy of striucture for various Lattice constants and choose the optimal lattice constant the one which gives minimum energy.
