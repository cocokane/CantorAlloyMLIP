Folder Contents:
Each folder contains input files for performing the validations of the trained MTP against MEAM & DFT.

The plotting scripts for each can be found in the potting_scripts folder within utility_scripts in parent directory.

All physical properties and scaling behaviour calculations are performed on 18x18x18 structures (23300 atoms) (compare MEAM, MTP)

EV curve (equation of state) estimation is performed on 108 atom structure (compare DFT, MEAM & MTP)

Energy, Stress, Force errors compared between trained MTP and DFT values on 108 atom structures.
