bash scripts for automating the training workflow of MTP.

Additional scripts for running each step of MTP Training:
train.cfg(train configurations concatenated)
test.cfg (test configurations concatenated)
mlip.ini(describes the current mode in which the MLIP package should run(mindist calculation, training, active learning, etc))
pot.mtp(actual mtp potential file whose parameters gets tuned during training)

Step1(mindist calculation):
script to calculate the minnimum distance between 2 atoms across all the structures in the dataset.

Step2 (training):
initial training of the the MTP.

step3 (active learning) :
step 1:
training 
error estimation
simulate trained mtp on NPT trajectory
when simulation breaks down add all generated structures whose extrapolation grade exceeds threshold to the train set
retrain until potential is stable.

step 2:
training 
error estimation
simulate trained mtp on multiple trajectories at different temperatures, lattice constants, etc
when simulation breaks down add all generated structures whose extrapolation grade exceeds threshold to the train set
retrain until potential is stable.
